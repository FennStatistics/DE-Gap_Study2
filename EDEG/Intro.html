Welcome to the Decision-making Game

<h5>Please read the instructions carefully! </h5>
<div>
    

    <p>
        This is a decision-making study.
        You will play a game for {{num_rounds}} rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        In each round, you will choose between two options: Option A or Option B. After your choice, you will
        see the result of both options: the one you chose and the one you did not choose. <strong> Your choices will
            impact your payoff<span class="Exp_Con"> and the environment</span>:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="Exp_Con">
            <b>Your choices have environmental consequences.</b> Some options cause <b>carbon (CO2) emissions in
                the real world.</b> Prior to the study, we purchased CO2 emission certificates. There is only a
                limited number of certificates on the market, and they regulate how much CO2 can be emitted in total. Think of a CO2 certificate as an allowance to emit a certain amount of CO2. If you choose an option that causes CO2 emissions, we will sell the corresponding amount of CO2 certificates, allowing the buyer to emit this amount of CO2. If you choose an option without CO2 emissions, we will calculate how much CO2 you saved compared to the other option. We will then destroy carbon certificates corresponding to your CO2 savings. Once the CO2 certificate is destroyed and taken off the market, it reduces the total amount of emission allowances that can be purchased. With less certificates on the market, less carbon can be emitted in total.
                <strong> This means, carbon emissions will actually be realized in the real world following your choices.
                </strong>
        </li>


        <li> <strong>Your bonus payment depends on your choices.
            </strong> Depending on your choices, you will either earn or lose points. 20 points will be equivalent to
            £1 (which equals to around USD $1.25). Your initial bonus payment is set to £1. This means, if you lose 20 points, your bonus payment will be £0, if you earn 20 points, your bonus payment will be £2.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p> At the end of the study, <b></b>one round will be randomly drawn.</b> <span class="Exp_Con">The carbon emissions of your choice in that
        round will then be realized.</span> The points you earned or lost in that round will be converted into British Pounds. 
        (conversion rate: 200 points &#8793; £1 which is around USD $1.25) and will be added to your initial bonus payment of £1. Note that your bonus
        payment is never negative. The minimum bonus payment you can get is £0. </p>

<div>
    <p>
        Example: Imagine you played 2 rounds. In round 1, you lost 100 points<span class="Exp_Con"> and the carbon emissions were 20kg</span>,
        in round 2 you gained 50 points<span class="Exp_Con">and 0kg of carbon emissions</span>.
        At the end, the computer will draw randomly either round 1 or round 2. If round 1 is drawn, your payoff will be
        - 100 points, divided by 200 = - £0.5. Your bonus payment will thus be £1 (initial endowment) - £0.5 = £0.5 (around USD $0.62). <span class="Exp_Con">The carbon emissions of 20kg will be realized by selling a CO2 certificate
        that allows the buyer to emit 20kg of CO2.</span> 
    </p>

    <p>
        If you will not finish the study all the way to the last round, you will not receive any payment.
